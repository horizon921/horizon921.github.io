I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes machine learning, computer vision, robotics and large language models.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shanghang Zhang]([https://www.XXX.com/](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/)) of HMI Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.
